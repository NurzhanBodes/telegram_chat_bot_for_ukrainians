Hack&amp;Heal Hachkathon Watt team project
This is project of or team which we developed on Hack and Heal Hackathon. Our team created a Telegram Chat bot which main task to help Ukrainian people suffering from war. Bot uses data from web and some information to refugees. For air-raid maps of Ukraine we used web site of alerts and took photo of it by selenium package which took screenshot of webpage. 
Bot is working and could give real helpful data to refugees. Still project has some improvements which should be made. If anyone has ideas to improve it, please contact me:)
